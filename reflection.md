What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think it really helped that I already have a good amount of experience with both Java and Python so after understanding 
what the assignment was, it was relatively OK to create the objected oriented resale shop. It definentely did take multiple
iterations and testing, so I would say to at least start this two days before the due date if you are a big procrastinater!
